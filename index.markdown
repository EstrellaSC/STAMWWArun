Since 2022, I have assembled and collected the Sound-Textual Archive of Muslim Women in West Africa (STAMWWA). 
As the main researcher and investigator, this archive serves as a repository of voices, aiming to convey the audible visions and narratives of a group of Muslim women from West Africa (and its diaspora) on various current issues related to their beliefs and practical challenges. 
My research is centred on the intellectual history of Formative Islam, focusing on the concept of knowledge (ilm) as it emerged in the Arabic written tradition. 
It seeks to understand premodern to trans-modern monotheistic epistemologies, examining the interplay between textual and oral modes of transmission and technology. 
The STAMWWA has obtained the express consent of the women who participated and completed the questionnaire. 
The STAMWWA is a multilingual, intermedial platform including audio and textual elements. 
The STAMWWA audio files are stored on a personal drive and can be accessed in full upon request by contacting:
essamba@ucm.es
